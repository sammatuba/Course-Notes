# AWS Training - Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview
- data -> processing -> predictions -> decision -> results -> data
- machine learning can: make predictions, optimize utility funcions, extract hidden data structures, and classify data

## Use Cases
- Fraud detection: Mine data -> Identify Patterns -> Train Model -> Flag transaction as fraudulent
- Content Personalization: use predictive analytics models to recommend items
- Targeted Marketing: use prior customer activity to choose the most relevant email campaigns for target customers
- Categorization: unstructured content -> ML Model -> Categorized documents
- Customer Service: analyze social media traffic to route customer care specialists

## Key Concepts
- Machine Learning: methods and systems that
	- Predict
	- Extract
	- Summarize
	- Optimize
	- Adapt
- Types of Machine Learning Problems:
	- Unsupervised
	- Supervised
		- Classification
		- Regression
	- Reinforcement
- Supervised Learning
	- teaches the model by providing a dataset with inputs and outputs
	- human teacher's expertise is used to tell the model which outputs are correct
	- Input -> Model -> Output/Prediction
	- further grouped into classification (binary and multiclass) and regression
- Unsupervised Learning
	- No external teacher or pre-trained data
	- Model detects emerging properties in the input dataset
	- Model constructs patterns or clusters
	- further grouped into clustering and association
- Reinforcement Learning
	- Input -> Software Agent -> Action ->> (Reward Feedback)

## Machine Learning and Smart Applications
- Challenges
	- Expertise
	- Scaling
	- Time to Operationalize

## Amazon Machine Learning
- Amazon Machine Learning
- Amazon EMR
- Spark and SparkML

## Case Study - Zillow
- Challenges
	- Provide timely home evaluations for all new homes
	- Perform machine-learning jobs in hours instead of a dayy
	- scale storage and compute capacity on demand
- Solution
	- Runs Zestimate, Zillow's machine learning-based home-evaluation tool on AWS
	- Gives customers more accurate data on more than 100 million homes
