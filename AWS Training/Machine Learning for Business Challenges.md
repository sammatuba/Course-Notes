# Machine Learning for Business Challenges

## Machine Learning for Business Leaders 
How business leaders can help their teams maximize project results by leveraging the machine learning toolkit

- "When is machine learning an appropriate tool to solve my problem?"
- Machine learning is NOT a *one-stop shop* that can solve any business problem
	- needs sufficient data
	- does not necessarily provide causality 
- When is Machine Learning an Option? 
	- If the problem is persistent
	- If the problem challenges progress or growth
	- If the solution needs to scale
	- If the problem requires personalization in order to be solved
- What Does a Successful ML Solution Require
	- People: data scientists, ML engineers, etc
	- Time: setting up a data pipeline
	- Cost
- Questions:
	- What are the made assumptions? (related to data and model)
	- What is your learning target? (learning output, hypothesis)
	- What type of ML problem is it?
	- Why did you choose this algorithm?
	- How will you evaluate the model performance?
	- How confident are you that you can generalize the results?
