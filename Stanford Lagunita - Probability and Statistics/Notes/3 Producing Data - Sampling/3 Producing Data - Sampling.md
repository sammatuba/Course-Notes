# Producing Data: Sampling

## Introduction
- first stage: sampling, second stage: study design

## Sampling: Types of Samples
- volunteer sample: individuals select themselves to be included; such sample is almost guaranteed to be biased
- convenience sample: individuals happend to be at the right time and place to suit the schedule of the researcher
- sampling frame: list of potential individuals to be sampled; should match the population as closely as possible
- systematic sampling:
- simple random sampling: the sample is not subject to any bias if nonresponse is minimal

## Sampling: Probability Sampling Plans
- any plan that relies on random selection is called a **probability sampling plan** 
	- simple random sampling: each individual has the same chance of being selected
	- cluster sampling: used when population is naturally divided into groups (called clusters)
	- stratified sampling: used when population is naturally divided into sub-populations (called stratum) 

## Summary
- statistics: use information from a sample to draw conclusions about a larger group, called population. 
- first step is obtain a sample of individuals representative of the population
- bias may be eliminated in theory or at least reduced in practice if researchers implement a probability sampling plan utilizing randomness
- Generally speaking, a probability sampling plan (simple random sample, cluster, stratified sampling) will result in a nonbiased sample, which can be safely used to make inferences
- When nonrandom sampling techniques are used, one should be aware of the types of bias that they introduce and thus the limitations of the conclusions that can be drawn from the sample
