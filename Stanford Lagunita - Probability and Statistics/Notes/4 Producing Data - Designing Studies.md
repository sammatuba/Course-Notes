# Producing Data: Designing Studies

## Introduction
After the first stage (sampling) in the data production process is completed, the second stage is designing studies with the goal of gaining information about the variables of interest from the sample individuals.

Three study designs:
- **observational study**: values of the variables of interest are recorded as they naturally occur without interference from the researchers
- **sample survey**: special type of observational study where individuals report variable's values themselves by giving their opinions
- **experiment**: researchers assign and "take control" of the values of the explanatory variable to see how changes in the values affect the response variable. By nature any experiment involves at least two variables.

The type of design and its details determine what kind of conclusions one may draw from the results. It was established that an association between two variables does not guarantee that a causal relationship exists but details of a study design can play a crucial role in determining the ability to establish evidence of causation.

## Identifying Study Design: Types of Studies

*Example*
---
Suppose researchers want to determine whether people tend to snack more while they watch television. In other words, the researchers would like to explore the relationship between the explanatory variable "TV" (a categorical variable that takes the values "on'" and "not on") and the response variable "snack consumption."
---

1. Experiment

Recruit participants for a study. While they are presumably waiting to be interviewed, half of the individuals sit in a waiting room with snacks available and a TV on. The other half sit in a waiting room with snacks available and no TV, just magazines. Researchers determine whether people consume more snacks in the TV setting.

2. Observational Study (Prospective)

Recruit participants for a study. Give them journals to record hour by hour their activities the following day, including when they watch TV and when they consume snacks. Determine if snack consumption is higher during TV times.

3. Observational Study (Retrospective)

Recruit participants for a study. Ask them to recall, for each hour of the previous day, whether they were watching TV, and what snacks they consumed each hour. Determine whether snack consumption was higher during the TV times.

4. Sample Survey

Poll a sample of individuals with the following question: While watching TV, do you tend to snack: (a) less than usual; (b) more than usual; or (c) the same amount as usual?

In general, with a well-designed experiment we have a better chance of establishing causation than with an observational study. However, experiments are also subject to certain pitfalls, and there are many situations in which an experiment is not an option. A well-designed observational study may still provide fairly convincing evidence of causation under the right circumstances.

## Identifying Study Design: Experiments vs. Observational Studies

### Experiments vs Observational Studies
- observational study: population -> [random selection] -> sample -> [values of the explanatory variable are "self-assigned"]
- experiment: population -> [random selection] -> sample -> [values of the explanatory variables are assigned by researchers]

### Causation and Obserational Studies: Lurking Variables and other Pitfalls
- Due to the existence of virtually unlimited number of potential lurking variables, we can never be 100% certain of a claim of causation based on an observational study
- If pitfalls are avoided by controlling the lurking variables and if common sense indicates that there is a good reason for one variable to cause changes in the other, researchers may assert that an observational study provides good evidence of causation 
- The key to establishing causation is to ensure that individuals differ only with respect to the values of the explanatory variable

### Sample Surveys: Design Issues
- open questions: less restrictive, but responses are more difficult to summarize
- closed questions: may be biased by the options provided
vs. closed questions: open question allows for unlimited responses, thus unlimited categories, and is harder to handle than closed
- unbalanced response questions: 
- leading questions
- planting ideas with questions
- complicated questions
- sensitive questions: one effective technique is **randomized response** which allows individuals to answer questions anonymously

## Experiments with One Explanatory Variable

### Causation and Experiments
Experiment
- explanatory variable (or factor) is the method used
= treatments: the different imposed values of the explanatory variable
= treatment groups: the groups receiving different treatments
- control group: group where the individuals do not receive an imposed treatment
- Ideally, the subjects (human participants in an experiment) in each treatment group differ from those in the other treatment groups to minimize the effect of lurking variables by eliminating all other differences among treatment groups

### Randomized Controlled Experiments
- random assignment to treatments is the best way to prevent treatment groups of individuals fro differing from each other in ways other than the treatment assigned
- Under random assignment, the groups should not differ significatly with respect to any potential lurking variable. Then if a relationship is seen between the explanatory and response variables, there is an evidence that it is a causal one
- random sample -> assign individuals randomly to treatment groups

### Inclusion of a Control Group
- common misconception: an experiment must include a control group of individuals receiving no treatment. There may be situations where a complete lack of treatment is not an option, or where including a control group is ethically questionable, or where researchers explore the effects of a treatment without making a comparison. 

### Blind and Double-Blind Experiments
- Blind experiment: subjects are *blind* to the treatment administered to them
- *placebo effect*: when the patients improve because they are told they are receiving treatment, even though they are not actually receiving treatment; *placebo*: dummy treatment that looks like the treatment being administered in the study
- researchers who evaluate the response may also be *blind* to which treatment the subject received, to prevent the *experiment effect* from influencing their assessments
- Double-Blind experiment: when neither the subjects nor the researchers know who was assigned to what treatmnent
- The most reliable way to determine whether the explanatory variable is actually causing changes in the response variable is to carry out a **randomized controlled double-blind experiment**

### Pitfalls in Experimentation
- Hawthorne effect: whereby people in an experiment behave differently from how they would normally behave
- lack of realism (lack of ecological validity)
- Noncompliance: failure to submit to the assigned treatment
- treatments that are unethical, impossible, or impractical to impose

### Summary
1. Observational studies:
- The explanatory variable's values are allowed to occur naturally.
- Because of the possibility of lurking variables, it is difficult to establish causation.
- If possible, control for suspected lurking variables by studying groups of similar individuals separately.
- Some lurking variables are difficult to control for; others may not be identified.

2. Experiments
- The explanatory variable's values are controlled by researchers (treatment is imposed).
- Randomized assignment to treatments automatically controls for all lurking variables.
- Making subjects blind avoids the placebo effect.
- Making researchers blind avoids conscious or subconscious influences on their subjective assessment of responses.
- A randomized controlled double-blind experiment is generally optimal for establishing causation.
- A lack of realism may prevent researchers from generalizing experimental results to real-life situations.
- Noncompliance may undermine an experiment. A volunteer sample might solve (at least partially) this problem.
- It is impossible, impractical or unethical to impose some treatments.

## Experiments with Multiple Explanatory Variables
---
Example experiment with two explanatory variables and a response variable:
The researchers are interested in the effect of diet and two new drugs on blood pressure. Subjects are assigned to either Control Diet (no restrictions), Diet #1, or Diet #2, and are also assigned to receive either Placebo, Drug #1, or Drug #2. To set up such an experiement, there has to be one treatment group for every combination of categories of the two explanatory variables. Thus, in this case, there are 3 * 3 = 9 combinations. Subjects would be randomly assigned to one of the nine treatment groups. If we find differences in the proportions of subjects who achieve the lower "moderate zone" blood pressure among the nine treatment groups, then we have evidence that the diets and/or drugs may be effective for reducing blood pressure.
---

### Modifications to Randomization
Blocking - dividing the subjects into groups of individuals who are similar with respect ao an outside variable that may be important in the relationship being studied; within each block, subjects are randomly assigned to treatments
Matched Pairs Design - may enable to pinpoint the effects of the explanatory variable by comparing responses for the same individual under two explanatory values, or for two individuals who are similar as possible

## Wrap-up (Designing Studies)
In this section we distinguished among different types of studies and learned the details of each type of study design. By doing so, we also expanded our understanding of the issue of establishing causation that was first discussed in the previous unit of the course. **In the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we learned that in general, association does not imply causation, due to the fact that lurking variables might be responsible for the association we observe, which means we cannot establish that there is a causal relationship between our "explanatory" variable and our response variable.**

In this section we completed the causation puzzle by learning under what circumstances an observed association between variables CAN be interpreted as causation. We saw that in observational studies, the best we can do is to control for what we think might be potential lurking variables, but we can never be sure that there aren't any others that we didn't anticipate. Therefore, we can come closer to establishing causation, but never really establish it.

**The only way we can, at least in theory, eliminate the effect of (or control for) ALL lurking variables is by conducting a randomized control experiment, in which subjects are randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups.** Only in this case can we interpret an observed association as causation. Obviously, due to ethical or other practical reasons, not every study can be conducted as a randomized experiment. Where possible, however, a double-blind randomized control experiment is about the best study design we can use.

Another very common study design is the survey. While a survey is a special kind of observational study, it really is treated as a separate design, since it is so common and is the type of study that the general public is most often exposed to (polls). It is important that we be aware of the fact that the wording, ordering, or type of questions asked in a poll could have a impact on the response. In order for a survey's results to be reliable, these issues should be carefully considered when the survey is designed.


## Summary (Producing Data)
- production of data happens in two stages: **sampling** and **study design**
- Sampling - get a **sample that represents the population of interest well** so that making conclusions based on the sample about the entire population will make sense
- probability of sampling plans: **simple random sample**, in theory, is supposed to provide a sample not subject to any bias
- With observational studies, it is **difficult to establish** convincing evidence of a **causal relationship**, because of lack of control over outside variables (called lurking variables). 
- **Experiments** allow researchers to take control of lurking variables by **randomized assignment to treatments**, which helps provide more convincing evidence of causation.
- **Sample surveys** are occasionally used to examine relationships, but often they assess values of many separate variables, such as respondents' opinions on various matters.
